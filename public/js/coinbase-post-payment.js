/*
  In theory, we can trigger an action after the
  coinbase_payment_complete event fires, e.g. to replace the
  internals of the <div class="span6 offset3 order"> 
  with something other than 
  <strong><i class="icon-ok"></i> Paid</strong>

  Right now this event isn't firing properly on either HTTP or HTTPS pages. 
  Coinbase is fixing the bug. See documentation of intended functionality here:
  https:  coinbase.com/docs/merchant_tools/payment_buttons

  Once that's fixed, you can have a nicer checkout experience.
