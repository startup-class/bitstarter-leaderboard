/* 
  Set up the Angular.js controllers, the A in the MEAN stack (from mean.io).

  This code updates the thermometer dynamically. It's the client-side
  function within the page that sets up the OrdersCtrl controller on the
  homepage.

  NOTE: For simplicity we've hardcoded the path to the corresponding
  /api/orders route defined in routes.js in API_ORDER_ROUTE. If you have a
  large number of routes to share between client- and server-side code and
  really want single-point-of-truth for route definitions, one approach is
  to define a separate file or variable with public route names meant to be
  seen on the client side and then import that on both the client- and
  server-side (and then perhaps obfuscate the code prior to serving it up).
