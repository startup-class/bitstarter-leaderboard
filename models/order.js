   Object/Relational mapping for instances of the Order class.

    - instances correspond to rows
    - fields correspond to columns

   In other words, this code defines how a row in the PostgreSQL "Order"

		  This method is implemented naively and can be slow if

		  The ideal solution would first determine in bulk which of the
		  potentially new orders in order_json is actually new (and not
		  stored in the database). One way to do this is via the NOT IN
		  operator, which calculates a set difference:
		  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-comparisons.html
		  This should work for even a large set of orders in the NOT IN
		  clause (http://stackoverflow.com/a/3407914) but you may need
		  to profile the query further.

		  Once you have the list of new orders (i.e. orders which are
		  in Coinbase but not locally stored in the database), then
		  you'd want to launch several concurrent addFromJSON calls
		  using async.eachLimit
		  (https://github.com/caolan/async#eachLimit). The exact value
		  of the limit is how many concurrent reads and writes your
		  Postgres installation can handle. This is outside the scope
		  of the class and depends on your Postgres database settings,
		  the tuning of your EC2 instance, and other parameters. For a
		  t1.micro, we just set this to 1 to prevent the system from
		  hanging.
